I'm a software developer with more than 15 years of experience developing web and mobile applications.

I taught myself programming on the Commodore 64 when I was 9 years old and created my first web site at 16. In 1998 I went to the University of Canterbury to study Computer Science. However, my passion for web design led me to take a short-cut into the industry by completing the first web technology course at the National College of Design and Technology. In 2000 I got my first job as a web developer.

In 2006 I followed the path of many young kiwis and moved to London with my girlfriend (now wife) to explore Europe and further my development career. I worked as a contract .NET developer for clients such as the [BBC](http://bbcworldwide.com), [uSwitch.com](http://uswitch.com), [ITV](http://itv.com) and [Vodafone](http://vodafone.co.uk).

After several years we moved back to New Zealand where I co-founded [elucidcode](http://elucidcode.com), a mobile app development company. We recently launched [Air Pipes](http://airpip.es), a musical instrument app that climbed to number 1 music and number 7 overall paid app on the UK App Store.

I am now based in Christchurch and work for a San Francisco-based consultancy developing apps for iOS and Rails.
